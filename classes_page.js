        <h1>Classes</h1>
        <p>We offer classes for beginners and experienced dancers. You can also join our performance team.</p>


        <h2>Beginner Classes</h2>
        <p>Our beginner classes are targeted to people who have never done ballroom dancing before, or who haven’t danced ballroom recently. You’ll learn the fundamentals of standing up straight and moving with a partner, as well as a set of moves and technique specific to each dance.</p>

        <p>You do not need to bring your own partner. During classes, we switch partners every few minutes, so you get to dance with lots of different people.</p>

        <p>Taking the beginner classes will make you a strong social dancer. You can also (optionally) compete at ballroom dance competitions at the Newcomer and Bronze levels, which are designed specifically for people who have not been dancing ballroom long.</p>

        <p>The Newcomer level at competitions is only for competitors with less than 12 months ballroom dance experience.</p>


        <h2>Intermediate Classes</h2>
        <p>The intermediate classes are for dancers who have been dancing for a year or more and who have a strong knowledge of Bronze figures. You are expected to have good dance posture and frame. The topics in the intermediate class vary from year to year, but usually focus on higher level technique and more difficult figures.</p>

        <p>The moves learned in the intermediate class are generally used in competition, not for social dancing. Therefore, intermediate dancers are expected to compete with the team. Most intermediate dancers are competing at the Bronze and Silver levels; some compete in Silver and Gold.</p>


        <h2>Performance Team</h2>
        <p>The performance team is a group of students within the Ballroom and Latin Dance Team that performs choreographed group dances at a variety of events. Any member of the Ballroom and Latin Dance Team can join the performance team, regardless of experience. Performance team meetings won’t conflict with class sessions.</p>
