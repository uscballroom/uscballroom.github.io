  board:
    - name: Erin Soares
      position: President
      image_file: Erin.jpg
      description: <p>Erin Soares is a senior and this is her fourth year on the team. She was brand new to ballroom dancing when she joined her freshman year and the rest is history. Erin is now the president of the team and oversees basically everything that happens, she spends far more time working with the team than she does on anything else, and she wouldn't have it any other way. If you need anything at all you should always feel free to talk to her! When Erin isn't doing ballroom things (which, let's be real, is almost never) she is working on her double major in Theatre and Italian. If you ever need to bribe her, a good place to start is with pigs and gummy bears.</p>

      description: <p>Katy is a Junior neuroscience major and loves all things brain related.

She has now been on the team for a year and a half and manages the team's finances as well as organizes Glamour Smackdown, the team's competition (ask her about it). She mostly dances American smooth with her partner but will dance Rhythm any chance she can get.  Her favorite style is tango and also enjoys going out social swing dancing.</p>

Although her family worries that she eats, sleeps, and breathes ballroom (she kind of does, considering her roommates are all fellow board members), Dana is proud to be an Annenberg student and Communication major. When she's not in class or dancing, Dana spends her free time binge-reading, cooking, and obsessively scrolling through Pinterest.</p>
