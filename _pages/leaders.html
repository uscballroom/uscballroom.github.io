      image_file: Erin.jpg
      description: <p>Ashley is a senior and a Biological Sciences major who is gearing up to be an optometrist.

    - name: Queenique Dinh
      position: Treasurer
      image_file: Katy.jpg
      description: <p>Queenique Dinh is a sophomore studying astronautical engineering who joined the team her freshman year. As the treasurer, she takes care of the team’s finances so we can have wonderful things like professional coaches and fun social events. From the age of three through fourteen, she competed with various dance teams, and she was ecstatic that ballroom brought her back to the dance floor again. When she’s not studying rocket science or dancing, Queenique loves scoping out good food and drinking copious amounts of boba.</p>
    - name: Dana Dinh
      position: Competition Coordinator
      image_file: Mark.jpg
      description: <p>Dana is a junior and NorCal girl who joined the team in fall 2016. She is in charge of registering team members for competitions, organizing the team's trips to other schools, and helping new members find partners. Although her family worries that she eats, sleeps, and breathes ballroom (she kind of does, considering her best friends are all fellow board members), Dana is proud to be an Annenberg student and Communication major. When she's not in class or dancing, Dana spends her free time binge-reading, cooking, playing with her cat Alice, and obsessively scrolling through Pinterest.</p>

      description: <p>Sara is a senior majoring in applied math and minoring in applied analytics. She joined the team in Fall 2016 and helps organize the team’s social and volunteer events. Her daily routine often consists of satisfying constant orange juice cravings, listening to alternative rock music, and missing any and all pop culture references.</p>

      position: Social Co-Chair
      image_file: Sara.jpg
      description: <p>Zoe is a Senior studying non-Computer Science, from not right here in Ohio! She's bad at writing bios, so Alex wrote hers, but she likes people, places, and things!</p>

He likes board games, Sci-Fi/Fantasy, rock climbing, terrain races, and throwing himself into unnecessarily dangerous situations! (He's also a Marathon runner, I guess.) He is in charge of sending the weekly newsletter and monitoring the club email account.</p>
